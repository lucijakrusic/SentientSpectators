# SentientSpectators


This is the repository of SentimetnSpectators project which builds upon the DiSpecs project.
In the project, we create a small evaluation gold standard corpus for Sentiment Analysis of Spanish Enlightenment plays, using expert annotators.

The folder '1_sentiment_annotation' consists of the following notebooks:
- Annotation_evaluation - in which the annotations are evaluated using inter-rater agreement
- Gold_standard_3_annotators - in which a gold standard is created for second round of annotations (3 annotators)
 - Gold_standard_4_annotators - in which a gold standard is created for second round of annotations (4 annotators)


...and two folders:
- input 
- gold_standard_corpus
